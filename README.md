# Life-Of-Ball
This is a 3D arcade style game made using Unity3D in which the player controls a ball and has to jump over platforms.

This game is also about decision making. After stepping on a platform, three new platforms generate. Some of them may be red, but you want to avoid the red ones because they will break if you step on them. The green platforms will slowly turn red and break, so the player has to keep moving. The decision making is not just about choosing the right platforms, it is also choosing how to best prepare to change directions quickly.
